things that suck
I came across a video recently titled “How to not be an NPC”. TLDR, it basically says “remind yourself why you do what you do”, instead of simply mindlinessly drifting through life.<pr></p>For the longest time, I’d been chasing happiness. Just the pure feeling of happiness with nothing in between that could taint it. I also chased “proudness”, and “legacy”. I wanted to grind and be the protagonist that saves my family, those close to me; even the world.<pr></p>With you, it was different. Yes, our happy moments are heart-warmingly fluttering in my soul. But, what I’ve learned to find peace with is the inevitability of pain, mundaneness, awkwardness, and anxiousness in ours — and any — relationship. Indeed, it’s what helps us become better individuals — and in this sense, it’s reshaped my view of what to chase.<pr></p>I look forward every day with you to chase not just the proud and sunlit moments, but to embrace the pain; the mundaneness; the awkwardness; the anxiousness. The things that suck.<pr></p>Because when I’m with you, even the most imperfect moments feel meaningful. They remind me that love isn’t just about the highs — it’s about the choice to be present, even in the lows. It’s about building a life together, not in pursuit of perfection, but in the messy, beautiful, slutty, and sometimes unremarkable moments that make us who we are.<pr></p>With you, I’ve learned that chasing something greater doesn’t mean running from pain or imperfection; it means running toward a shared life, with all its flaws, together.<pr></p>So, here’s to the journey — the light, the dark, and everything in between. With you, I wouldn’t want it any other way.<pr></p>Yours always,<pr></p>Long
