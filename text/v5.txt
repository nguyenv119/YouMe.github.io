things that suck
Elizabeth, my love,<p></p>Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here, waiting with a heart that is both broken and full, aching for the moment we can stand side by side again. I miss you in ways words stumble to capture, and I love you in layers I haven’t even begun to unravel. The distance between us doesn’t lessen the weight of your absence, but neither does it dwindle the quiet strength that I carry in the hope of our reunion.<p></p>Whatever comes, whatever we face, we’ll navigate it together. Not because we must, but because we can. We’ll move through this uncertainty, hand in hand—one step, one breath at a time. I'll hold you when the world feels too heavy, and we’ll find the strings of light threaded in the darkest of places.<p></p>The road ahead is unpredictable, yes. But you and I? We have each other and that alone is enough to keep us steady. So take my hand, whenever you’re ready. I’ll be here, waiting, believing that together we can face anything. Always.<p></p>Long
