Hello, darling. I want this to be completely unedited and raw. I don't regret anything that I've done with you. I am thankful for the time you have given me despite the rough patches that have came in my life. Thank you for your kindness, reassuring me in times of uncertainty. THank you for being honest with me. So caring and kind-hearted, I feel so safe and myself, and unafraid to say anything because I know, like the two protagonists in the movie, that you will know, deep down, that I mean well. We try our best to understand one another, try our best to learn and be our best. There's nothing more I can ask for.  There were days of uncertainty, but we go through them and became stronger. There will be rougher days for you, for me, and for us. But let's stand together and hold each other. If you need space to think, just know I'll be leaning outside your door waiting for you. Elizabeth, I will always be willing to listen to you and hear your point of view, I promise. I promise I will never mean to hurt you, discourage you, and will always be there for you when you need it. I will answer any questions you have and be as open as I possibly can. Body to body, heart to heart, soul to soul, I love you so very much, Elizabeth. Inspect the element pookie!
