Dear Elizabeth<p></p>Every day, you guide me towards better communication, and for that, I'm incredibly grateful. We've often acknowledged that despite our best intentions, our actions can inadvertently cause pain. It's in these challenging moments — when stress clouds my thoughts or emotions overwhelm me — that I've come to cherish you most deeply.<p></p>For too long, I've seen myself as the flawless protagonist of my own story, rarely acknowledging my shortcomings. This mindset made it all too easy to often cast myself as the victim and you as the antagonist, even if briefly. But in the quiet moments of discomfort, you've taught me the invaluable lesson of thoughtful reflection before speaking.<p></p>It’s often I feel the pain of this long-distance. My heart aches to hold you close, to convey my feelings through the subtleties of body gestures and tone that <p></p> alone can’t capture. Yet, I'm incredibly grateful to go through the hell with you because I have someone who cares. Something I’m baffled of how lucky I am to have at every moment.<p></p>Through our inevitable misunderstandings, I'm always  learning to be a better partner — for you and for myself. I want you to feel safe in expressing your feelings, especially when my words sting. This is the essence of why I'm here: to be unequivocally yours. Your listener, your lover, always and forever.<p></p>To me, very thread — be it joy or hurtful or multithreaded — weaves us closer together. You are the melody to my beat — and with every beat of my heart, I pray that I get to nurture this beautiful connection we share.<p></p>Yours, and happy birthday again :)<p></p>I love you so much<p></p>Long
