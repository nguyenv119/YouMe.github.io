## Introduction
Welcome to our Specila's Day Website Invitation Guide! This guide is designed for anyone, regardless of their programming experience. You will learn how to personalize a special website to ask out your significant other for Valentine's Day. Let's make this day unforgettable!

## Steps to Customize Your Invitation

### Step 1: Locate the Files
You should have received a folder named `Valentines`. Inside, you'll find a file named `index.html` and possibly some other files (like CSS or JavaScript files).

### Step 2: Open `index.html`
Right-click on the `index.html` file and open it with your text editor. This file contains the main structure of your invitation.

### Step 3: Customize Your Message
In the `index.html` file, look for sections marked with comments like `<!-- Change this for a personal message -->`. Here, you can write your own messages. 

### Step 4: Set the Date and Day
You'll also find placeholders for the date and day of your special invitation. These are usually clearly marked. Replace them with the specific day and date you plan for your Valentine's surprise.

### Step 5: Save Your Changes
After making your changes, save the file. Go to 'File' on your text editor and click 'Save'.

### Step 6: Preview Your Invitation
To see how your invitation looks, install the "Live Server" extension on your IDE, then right click the `index.html` file and click "Open with Live Server"

### Step 7: Host Your Invitation
For your significant other to see this invitation, you'll need to host it online. You can use free hosting services like GitHub Pages: here is a tutorial on how to do so - https://pages.github.com/

### Step 9: Share the Link
Once your site is live, you will get a link. Share this link with your significant other on Valentine's Day!
